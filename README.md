# GGS.SX-FiveM-Alt-Checker

This is a tool to check alt accounts joining your server using the ggs.sx API, essentially.. it will go through your license's list and then if one of the gta licenses are banned they will not be able to join your server.

#THIS IS FOR QB-CORE ONLY.. If you want an ESX Version please let me know.

##config.lua

Please ensure you supply your API Key from GGS.SX.
